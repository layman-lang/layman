# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Test Suite

Layman supports object-oriented programming to structure complex applications. This suite tests the class system, object instantiation, and property management.

## Concepts Covered
- **Class Definition**: The `define class` syntax for creating new types.
- **Properties**: Defining fields (`has properties`) within a class.
- **Instantiation**: Creating new instances of a class using the `new` keyword (e.g., `the variable p is a new Person`).
- **Methods**: Defining functions that belong to a class and operating on instance data.
- **Inheritance**: (If supported) Subclassing and extending existing types.
