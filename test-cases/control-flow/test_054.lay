# test case 54
# description: Here is a test case description for Test Case Number 54:

# A program performing an asynchronous database query should complete executing and retrieve all results within 2 seconds after initiating the operation, ensuring data integrity and reliability in real-time applications. The test verifies that the application can handle concurrent async operations without causing delays or errors. It checks if the system successfully resolves and processes the results of a background task.

define function perform_async_database_query that takes dummy as Number and returns Number
  # simulate async database query
  return 5

define function retrieve_result_from_database that takes dummy as Number and returns Number
  # simulate retrieving result
  return 10

# simulate database operations
the variable operation_one of type Number is 1
the variable operation_two of type Number is 2

# test async query performance
the variable start_operation_time of type Number is 0
the variable query_result_one of type Number is call function perform_async_database_query with argument operation_one
the variable end_operation_time of type Number is 1

# check if operation completed within time limit
the variable time_taken of type Number is end_operation_time minus start_operation_time
the variable time_limit of type Number is 2

if time_taken is less than time_limit then
  the variable result of type Number is call function retrieve_result_from_database with argument query_result_one
  if result is not 0 then
    print "database query completed successfully"
  else
    print "database query failed"
  end if
else
  print "time limit exceeded"
end if

# test concurrent operations
the variable concurrent_result of type Number is call function perform_async_database_query with argument operation_two
print "concurrent operation completed"
print the variable concurrent_result
