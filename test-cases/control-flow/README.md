# Control Flow Test Suite

This directory tests the logic and flow control mechanisms of Layman. It verifies that the language can correctly branch, loop, and make decisions based on runtime data.

## Concepts Covered
- **Conditionals**: Validation of `if`, `else`, and `else if` structures. This includes testing boolean expressions, comparison operators (like `is`, `is not`, `greater than`), and nested conditionals.
- **Loops**:
    - `repeat`: A simple loop for iterating a fixed number of times.
    - `while`: A condition-based loop that runs as long as a predicate is true.
    - `for each`: Iteration over collections like lists or ranges.
- **Branching Logic**: Ensuring that code blocks within flow control statements are strictly scoped and executed only when their conditions are met.
