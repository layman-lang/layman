# test case 56
# description: Test Case 56: Simple Arithmetic Expression - This test checks that the program correctly evaluates a simple arithmetic expression involving addition and subtraction of 2 integers to produce an expected result. The input is a string containing the expression "8 + 2 - 3" and the expected output should be "7".

# evaluate the expression "8 + 2 - 3"
# step 1: add 8 + 2 = 10
the variable first_number of type Number is 8
the variable second_number of type Number is 2
the variable intermediate_result of type Number is first_number plus second_number

# step 2: subtract 3 from the result: 10 - 3 = 7
the variable third_number of type Number is 3
the variable result of type Number is intermediate_result minus third_number

# verify the result is 7
the variable expected_result of type Number is 7
if result is expected_result then
  print "test passed"
else
  print "test failed"
end if
print the variable result
