# test case 96
# description: The programming language should correctly perform addition and subtraction operations on 2 numbers, yielding a single numerical result that is accurate to within 1 decimal place. The test case will input values for x and y such as 10 and 5, and verify the output is 15, or -5 with an error margin of 0.01.

define function add_numbers that takes x as Number and y as Number and returns Number
  the variable total of type Number is x plus y
  return total

# test addition: x = 10, y = 5, result should be 15
the variable x of type Number is 10
the variable y of type Number is 5
the variable result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument x and argument y

# verify result is 15
if result is 15 then
  print "addition result is correct:"
  print the variable result
else
  print "addition result is incorrect"
  print the variable result
end if

# test subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
the variable subtraction_result of type Number is x minus y

# verify subtraction result
if subtraction_result is 5 then
  print "subtraction result is correct:"
  print the variable subtraction_result
else
  print "subtraction result is incorrect"
  print the variable subtraction_result
end if
