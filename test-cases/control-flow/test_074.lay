# test case 74
# description: Here is a test case description for test case number 74:

# Write an asynchronous function that retrieves data from a mock API and logs each step of the process to the console, including when the request is sent and when it receives a response. Then, verify that the logged messages include specific text and do not contain any errors or exceptions.

define function get_data_from_api that takes dummy as Number and returns Number
  print "starting to retrieve data"
  
  # simulate retrieving items
  the variable item_one of type Number is 1
  the variable item_two of type Number is 2
  
  # process each item
  the variable request_one of type Number is item_one
  print "requesting"
  print the variable request_one
  
  the variable response_one of type Number is request_one plus 10
  print "receiving response"
  
  if response_one is greater than 0 then
    print "response was successful"
    print "processing data"
  else
    print "error occurred"
    print "handling error"
  end if
  
  print "finished retrieving data"
  return response_one

# test async data retrieval
the variable dummy_value of type Number is 0
the variable api_result of type Number is call function get_data_from_api with argument dummy_value

print "api call completed"
print the variable api_result
