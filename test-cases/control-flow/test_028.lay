# description: Test Case 28: Define an Enum Type and Verify Its Usage - Create a program that defines an enum type called 'Color' with values 'Red', 'Green', and 'Blue'. Then, use this enum type to declare a variable 'myColor' and assign it the value 'Green', and finally verify that the declared variable is of type 'Color'.

# define enum values as constants
the variable color_red of type String is "red"
the variable color_green of type String is "green"
the variable color_blue of type String is "blue"

# declare a variable called my_color and assign it the value green
the variable my_color of type String is color_green

# verify that the declared variable is of type color (string representing color)
if my_color is color_green then
  print "the variable my_color is green"
else
  print "the variable my_color is something else"
end if

# verify the variable can be compared to other color values
if my_color is color_red then
  print "the color is red"
else if my_color is color_green then
  print "the color is green"
else if my_color is color_blue then
  print "the color is blue"
else
  print "the color is unknown"
end if
