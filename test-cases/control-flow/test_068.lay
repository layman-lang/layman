# test case 68
# description: The "Type Definitions and Usage" test case, Test Case Number 68, tests that a layman's programming language correctly defines and uses different data types, such as integers, strings, and booleans, to store and manipulate values in a program. The test generates an example program with correct type definitions and usage, ensuring that the language distinguishes between numeric and non-numeric inputs, handles string operations properly, and enforces boolean values within logical statements.

# use different data types: numbers, strings, and booleans
the variable person_name of type String is "john"
the variable person_age of type Number is 25

the variable user_name of type String is "jane"
the variable user_balance of type Number is 1000

# use numbers in a loop
the variable count of type Number is 0
the variable index of type Number is 1
while index is less than or equal to 5 do
  the variable count of type Number is count plus index
  the variable index of type Number is index plus 1
end while

# use boolean in conditional
the variable condition of type Bool is true
if condition is true then
  the variable result of type Number is count times 2
  print the variable result
else
  print "count is not greater than 10"
end if

# use string operations
the variable message of type String is "hello"
the variable world_text of type String is " world"
the variable greeting of type String is call function concatenate with argument message and argument world_text
print the variable greeting

# verify type distinctions: numeric vs non-numeric
the variable numeric_value of type Number is 10
the variable text_value of type String is "10"
if numeric_value is 10 then
  print "numeric value is correct"
end if
if text_value is "10" then
  print "text value is correct"
end if
