# test case 79
# description: Here is a possible test case description for Layman Programming Language Test Case Number 79:

# The test case will validate that the design operation correctly generates a list of all unique room types in a given furniture catalog, without including any duplicates or errors. The test will verify that the output can be accurately sorted alphabetically and displayed in descending order by size, demonstrating correct sorting functionality for design operations.
