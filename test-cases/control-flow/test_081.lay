# test case 81
# description: The test case will create and assign values to 2 variables using a simple programming language, ensuring that variable declarations are properly utilized and assignments are accurate. The test will validate that variable names can be assigned integer values without causing syntax errors. The test aims to ensure the language's parser correctly handles basic variable operations.

# create and assign variables
the variable name of type Number is 5
the variable count of type Number is 0

# test variable operations
the variable count of type Number is count plus 1

# test function call
define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  the variable result of type Number is a plus b
  return result

the variable a_value of type Number is 3
the variable b_value of type Number is 7
the variable result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument a_value and argument b_value

# test conditional
if result is greater than 0 then
  the variable action of type String is "perform action"
  print the variable action
else
  the variable other_action of type String is "perform other action"
  print the variable other_action
end if

# test variable assignment
the variable item_type of type String is "item"
print the variable item_type

# test person name retrieval
the variable person_name of type String is "John"
print the variable person_name
print the variable name
