# test case 35
# description: A program is expected to calculate the total cost of a purchase after applying applicable discounts based on a customer's rewards status and the quantity purchased. The total cost should be displayed, including any adjustments for tax and shipping fees as specified by the program's settings.

# initialize purchase details
the variable base_cost of type Number is 0
the variable item_one_price of type Number is 10
the variable item_two_price of type Number is 5
the variable base_cost of type Number is base_cost plus item_one_price
the variable base_cost of type Number is base_cost plus item_two_price

# customer rewards status
the variable rewards_status of type String is "gold"

# apply rewards discount based on status
the variable discount_percent of type Number is 0
if rewards_status is "gold" then
  the variable discount_percent of type Number is 10
else if rewards_status is "silver" then
  the variable discount_percent of type Number is 5
else
  the variable discount_percent of type Number is 0
end if

# calculate discount amount (10% of base cost)
# for 10% discount: use 0.1 as multiplier
the variable discount_multiplier of type Number is 0.1
if discount_percent is 10 then
  the variable discount_multiplier of type Number is 0.1
else if discount_percent is 5 then
  the variable discount_multiplier of type Number is 0.5
else
  the variable discount_multiplier of type Number is 0
end if
the variable discount_amount of type Number is base_cost times discount_multiplier

# apply discount to cost
the variable cost_after_discount of type Number is base_cost minus discount_amount

# calculate tax (8 percent)
the variable tax_rate of type Number is 0.8
the variable tax_amount of type Number is cost_after_discount times tax_rate

# add tax to cost
the variable cost_with_tax of type Number is cost_after_discount plus tax_amount

# add shipping fee
the variable shipping_fee of type Number is 10
the variable total_cost of type Number is cost_with_tax plus shipping_fee

# print total cost
print "total cost equals"
print the variable total_cost
