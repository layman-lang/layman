# test case 62
# description: The program should take 2 integers as input and return their greatest common divisor (GCD), using a conditional statement to determine whether to use the Euclidean algorithm for odd or even numbers. The GCD calculation must be deterministic and produce the same result regardless of the order of inputs, and must handle edge cases such as 0 inputs correctly.

define function gcd that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  # handle edge case: if either number is 0, return the other
  if a is 0 then
    return b
  end if
  if b is 0 then
    return a
  end if
  
  # use euclidean algorithm
  the variable temp_a of type Number is a
  the variable temp_b of type Number is b
  
  while temp_b is not 0 do
    the variable remainder of type Number is temp_a modulo temp_b
    the variable temp_a of type Number is temp_b
    the variable temp_b of type Number is remainder
  end while
  
  return temp_a

# test with 2 numbers
the variable first_number of type Number is 12
the variable second_number of type Number is 18
the variable result of type Number is call function gcd with argument first_number and argument second_number

# verify result is 6
if result is 6 then
  print "gcd is correct"
else
  print "gcd calculation failed"
end if
print the variable result
