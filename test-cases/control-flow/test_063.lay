# test case 63
# description: The program is expected to execute a series of iterations using both for loops and while statements, with each iteration incrementing a counter variable until it reaches 10. The test case verifies that the program produces the correct output sequence in response to these iterations, including handling edge cases such as when the loop condition becomes false prematurely.

# initialize counter
the variable count of type Number is 0

# use while loop to iterate until count reaches 10
while count is less than 10 do
  the variable count of type Number is count plus 1
  print the variable count
end while

# use a second counter for additional iterations
the variable iteration of type Number is 1
while iteration is less than or equal to 10 do
  print the variable iteration
  the variable iteration of type Number is iteration plus 1
end while

# verify final count is 10
if count is 10 then
  print "iterations completed correctly"
else
  print "iterations did not complete correctly"
end if
