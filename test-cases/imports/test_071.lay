# test case 71
# description: Write a program that imports a math module and uses its functions to calculate the area of a rectangle, testing that the result is correct when both the length and width are provided.

import math_module

# test with different length and width values
the variable length of type Number is 2
the variable width of type Number is 3

# calculate area
the variable area_result of type Number is call function calculate_area with argument length and argument width

print "area of rectangle:"
print the variable area_result

# test with different values
the variable length_two of type Number is 3
the variable width_two of type Number is 4

the variable area_result_two of type Number is call function calculate_area with argument length_two and argument width_two

print "area of rectangle 2:"
print the variable area_result_two

# test with length = 1
the variable length_three of type Number is 1
the variable width_three of type Number is 5

the variable area_result_three of type Number is call function calculate_area with argument length_three and argument width_three

if area_result_three is greater than 0 then
  print "area calculation successful:"
  print the variable area_result_three
else
  print "an error message"
end if
