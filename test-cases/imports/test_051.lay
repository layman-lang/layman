# test case 51
# description: Here is a possible test case description for Test Case Number 51:

# Write a program that imports a mathematical module and uses its functions to calculate the area of a circle given its radius, then verifies the result matches an expected value.

import circle_module

define function calculate_area that takes radius as Number and returns Number
  the variable dummy_arg of type Number is 0
  the variable pi_value of type Number is call function calculate_pi with argument dummy_arg
  the variable radius_squared of type Number is call function calculate_square with argument radius
  the variable area of type Number is pi_value times radius_squared
  return area

# calculate area of circle with radius 5
the variable radius of type Number is 5
the variable area of type Number is call function calculate_area with argument radius

# calculate additional value
the variable dummy_arg of type Number is 0
the variable pi_value of type Number is call function calculate_pi with argument dummy_arg
the variable additional_value of type Number is 6.7085
the variable total of type Number is area plus additional_value
the variable total of type Number is total times pi_value

# verify result
if total is greater than 0 then
  the variable result of type Number is total
  print "the variable result:"
  print the variable result
else
  print "calculation error"
end if
