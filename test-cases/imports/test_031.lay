# test case 31
# description: A program should import an existing module named "math_module" and then use its functions to calculate the square root of a number to ensure it works correctly with imported modules.

import math_module

# simulate importing and using math functions
the variable number_one of type Number is 1
the variable number_four of type Number is 4
the variable number_nine of type Number is 9

# calculate square roots
the variable sqrt_one of type Number is call function get_square_root with argument number_one
the variable sqrt_four of type Number is call function get_square_root with argument number_four
the variable sqrt_nine of type Number is call function get_square_root with argument number_nine

# process each value
the variable value_one of type Number is sqrt_one
if value_one is greater than 0 then
  the variable result_one of type Number is value_one times 2

else
  the variable result_one of type Number is value_one times 3
  print "minus number and the square root of it times 3:"
  print the variable result_one
end if

if value_two is greater than 0 then
  the variable result_two of type Number is value_two times 2
  print "plus number and the square root of it times 2:"
  print the variable result_two
else
  the variable result_two of type Number is value_two times 3
  print "minus number and the square root of it times 3:"
  print the variable result_two
end if

the variable value_three of type Number is sqrt_nine
if value_three is greater than 0 then
  the variable result_three of type Number is value_three times 2
  print "plus number and the square root of it times 2:"
  print the variable result_three
