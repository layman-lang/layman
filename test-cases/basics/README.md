# Basics Test Suite

This directory contains the foundational test cases for the Layman programming language. These tests mimic the "Hello World" phase of learning a new language, focusing on the absolute essentials required to write any valid program.

## Concepts Covered
- **Variable Declaration**: Syntax for declaring mutable and immutable variables using natural language (e.g., `the variable x is 10`).
- **Basic Output**: Usage of the `print` statement to output text and numbers to the console.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Fundamental mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, verifying the parser's ability to handle infix operators and precedence.
- **Comments**: Verification that single-line comments (starting with `#`) are correctly ignored by the parser.
