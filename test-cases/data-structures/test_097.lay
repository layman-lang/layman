# test case 97
# description: The program should process a list of numbers, performing basic arithmetic operations to calculate the sum, average, and median of a given set of input values, ensuring accurate results for different input scenarios. The test case will validate that the program produces correct output when provided with a diverse set of inputs.

# process a list of numbers: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
the variable number_one of type Number is 5
the variable number_two of type Number is 10
the variable number_three of type Number is 15
the variable number_four of type Number is 20
the variable number_five of type Number is 25

# calculate sum
the variable sum of type Number is 0
the variable sum of type Number is sum plus number_one
the variable sum of type Number is sum plus number_two
the variable sum of type Number is sum plus number_three
the variable sum of type Number is sum plus number_four
the variable sum of type Number is sum plus number_five

# calculate average
the variable count of type Number is 5
the variable average of type Number is sum divided by count

# calculate median (middle value when sorted: 15)
the variable median of type Number is number_three

# print results
print "sum:"
print the variable sum
print "average:"
print the variable average
if count is 5 then
  print "median:"
  print the variable median
else
  print "median: not available"
end if
