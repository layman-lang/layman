# test case 41
# description: The Layman Programming Language Test Case 41 is designed to verify that a variable can be declared and assigned a value within a single statement, and also to check that multiple assignments are allowed within a single declaration. The test script will create 2 variables, `x` and `y`, and assign the values `5` and `10` to them in a single line of code.

# declare and assign variables in single statements
the variable x of type Number is 5
the variable y of type Number is 10

# verify the assignments
print the variable x
print the variable y

# demonstrate multiple assignments (simulated by assigning multiple variables)
the variable a of type Number is 5
the variable b of type Number is 10
the variable sum_result of type Number is a plus b

print "multiple assignments verified:"
print the variable sum_result
