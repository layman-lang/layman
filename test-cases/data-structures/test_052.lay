# test case 52
# description: Test Case 52: Validate Pipeline Operation - Process a list of numbers, first adding 2 to each number and then multiplying by 3.

define function process_list that takes input_list as List of Number and returns List of Number
  the variable result_list of type List of Number is an empty list
  
  for each number in input_list do
    # pipeline: add 2, then multiply by 3
    the variable step_one of type Number is number plus 2
    the variable step_two of type Number is step_one times 3
    result_list.add(step_two)
  end for
  
  return result_list

# test with sample numbers
the variable input_numbers of type List of Number is a list containing 5, 10

# process through pipeline
the variable pipeline_results of type List of Number is call function process_list with argument input_numbers

# verify: (5 + 2) * 3 = 21, (10 + 2) * 3 = 36
print "input:"
print input_numbers
print "pipeline results:"
print pipeline_results
