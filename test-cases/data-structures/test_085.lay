# test case 85
# description: The test case checks that a list comprehension correctly filters out even numbers from a list of integers, producing an output with only odd numbers as expected. It also verifies that the resulting list is generated in a single, efficient operation. The test should produce an output of [1, 3, 5] when given the input list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].

# simulate list of numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
the variable numbers of type List of Number is a list containing 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

# filter out even numbers (keep odd numbers)
the variable odd_numbers of type List of Number is an empty list

for each n in numbers do
    if n modulo 2 is not 0 then
        call add on odd_numbers with n
    end if
end for

# verify: all numbers in input are even, so result should be empty (0 odd numbers)
print "odd numbers count:"
the variable count of type Number is odd_numbers.size
print count

# test with odd numbers: [1, 3, 5]
the variable odd_input of type List of Number is a list containing 1, 3, 5
the variable odd_result of type List of Number is an empty list

for each n in odd_input do
    if n modulo 2 is not 0 then
        call add on odd_result with n
    end if
end for

print "result with [1, 3, 5]:"
the variable result_count of type Number is odd_result.size
print result_count
