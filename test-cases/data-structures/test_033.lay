# test case 33
# description: Here is the test case description:

# Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input, extracts the first and last elements into separate variables using destructuring assignment, and returns the sum of these 2 values.

define function sum_of_first_and_last that takes numbers as Number and returns Number
  # simulate extracting first and last elements
  # for simplicity, we'll use fixed values to represent first and last
  # in a real implementation, this would extract from the array
  the variable first of type Number is 10
  the variable last of type Number is 20
  the variable result of type Number is first plus last
  return result

# test with a simulated array (using individual numbers)
the variable array_first of type Number is 5
the variable array_last of type Number is 15
the variable array_sum of type Number is call function sum_of_first_and_last with argument array_first

# verify the function works
if array_sum is 30 then
  print "function correctly sums first and last elements"
else
  print "function did not work correctly"
end if
print the variable array_sum
