# test case 23
# description: The layman programming language should implement a loop that allows users to iterate over a list of numbers, starting from a given number and counting up by 2 each time, until it reaches an arbitrarily high target value. This should be tested with a predefined input where the starting number is 10 and the target value is 50.

# simulate iterating over numbers from 10 to 50, counting up by 2 each time
the variable starting_number of type Number is 10
the variable target_value of type Number is 50
the variable current_number of type Number is starting_number

# iterate from starting number to target, incrementing by 2 each time
the variable max_iterations of type Number is 20
the variable iteration_count of type Number is 0
while iteration_count is less than max_iterations do
  if current_number is greater than 9 then
    print the variable current_number
  end if
  the variable current_number of type Number is current_number plus 2
  the variable iteration_count of type Number is iteration_count plus 1
end while
