# test case 5
# description: Verify list creation, access, and iteration

# Create a list with 5 elements: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
the variable generated_list of type List of Number is the list containing 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

# Verify length
the variable list_len of type Number is call function len with argument generated_list
if list_len is 5 then
  print "Length is correct"
else
  print "Length is incorrect"
end if

# Verify values
the variable item1 of type Number is item 1 of generated_list
if item1 is 5 then
  print "Item 1 is correct"
else
  print "Item 1 is incorrect"
end if

the variable item5 of type Number is item 5 of generated_list
if item5 is 9 then
  print "Item 5 is correct"
else
  print "Item 5 is incorrect"
end if

# Loop through list
the variable sum of type Number is 0
for each item in generated_list do
  set sum to sum plus item
end for

# Sum should be 5+6+7+8+9 = 35
if sum is 35 then
  print "Sum is correct"
else
  print "Sum is incorrect"
end if
