# description: Test Case 37: Find the Maximum Number in a List.

define function find_max that takes input_list as List of Number and returns Number
  the variable max_val of type Number is 0
  # Initialize max with first element if possible, or just 0 assuming positive numbers
  # Since we can't easily get first element without index (unless we iterate), let's assume 0 is min.
  
  for each n in input_list do
    if n is greater than max_val then
      the variable max_val of type Number is n
    end if
  end for
  
  return max_val

# test with a list of numbers
the variable numbers of type List of Number is a list containing 10, 50, 25, 5, 100

# find the max number
the variable max_number of type Number is call function find_max with argument numbers

print "list:"
print numbers
print "max number:"
print max_number
