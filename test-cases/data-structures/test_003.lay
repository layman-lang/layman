# test case 3
# description: Test Case 3: "Find the Total Cost of Multiple Items" - This test verifies that a program can calculate and display the total cost of multiple items by iterating through a list and adding its price to a running total.

the variable prices of type List of Number is a list containing 5, 3, 2, 0
the variable running_total of type Number is 0

for each price in prices do
  if price is greater than 0 then
    the variable running_total of type Number is running_total plus price
  else
    the variable running_total of type Number is running_total plus 0
  end if
end for

if running_total is 10 then
  print "the result is 10"
else
  print "the result is not 10"
end if
