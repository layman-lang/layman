# description: Here is a possible test case description for Test Case Number 46:

# Test Case 46: "Adding and Retrieving Key-Value Pairs" - Write a program that defines an empty dictionary, adds a few key-value pairs to it, and then retrieves and prints out the values associated with specific keys.

# simulate dictionary with key-value pairs using variables
the variable names of type Dictionary of String to String is a dictionary with "person1" is "john", "person2" is "jane"
the variable ages of type Dictionary of String to Number is a dictionary with "person1" is 30, "person2" is 25

# count of people
the variable count_of_people of type Number is 2

# calculate average age
the variable age1 of type Number is ages["person1"]
the variable age2 of type Number is ages["person2"]
the variable total_age of type Number is age1 plus age2
the variable average_age of type Number is total_age divided by count_of_people

# verify we have enough people
if count_of_people is greater than 1 then
  print "average age:"
  print the variable average_age
else
  print "not enough people"
end if

# retrieve and print key-value pairs
print "person1 name:"
the variable name1 of type String is names["person1"]
print the variable name1
print "person1 age:"
print the variable age1

print "person2 name:"
the variable name2 of type String is names["person2"]
print the variable name2
print "person2 age:"
print the variable age2
