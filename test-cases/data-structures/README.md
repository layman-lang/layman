# Data Structures Test Suite

This suite focuses on the compound data types available in Layman—Lists and Dictionaries. These structures are essential for managing collections of data and are tested for correctness in creation, manipulation, and access.

## Concepts Covered
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items. Tests cover creating lists (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), adding/removing elements, and accessing items by index.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for mapping keys to values. Tests verify syntax for definition, retrieving values by key, and handling missing keys.
- **Iteration**: Using loops to traverse these data structures.
- **Properties**: Accessing built-in properties like `.size` or `.length` to retrieve metadata about the collection.
