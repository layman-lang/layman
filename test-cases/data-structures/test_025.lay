# description: Test Case 25: List Operations and Filtering

# Create a list of numbers between 10 and 20 (inclusive)
the variable numbers of type List of Number is a list containing 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

# Filter numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10)
the variable divisible_numbers of type List of Number is an empty list

for each n in numbers do
    if n modulo 10 is 0 then
        divisible_numbers.add(n)
    end if
end for

# Filter even numbers from the divisible numbers
the variable even_numbers of type List of Number is an empty list

for each n in divisible_numbers do
    if n modulo 2 is 0 then
        even_numbers.add(n)
    end if
end for

print even_numbers
