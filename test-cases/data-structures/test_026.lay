# test case 26
# description: Test Case 26: Verify dictionary lookup with existing key value pairs. The test will check that a correctly defined dictionary can successfully retrieve a previously stored value for a specific key, while ignoring any non-existent keys and returning undefined if requested.

# simulate dictionary with key-value pairs using variables
the variable person of type Dictionary is a dictionary with "name" is "John", "age" is 30

# function to add numbers
define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  the variable result of type Number is a plus b
  return result

# test the function
the variable result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument 5 and argument 3

# verify dictionary-like lookup by checking if key exists (simulated)
# check if name key exists (it does)
the variable person_name of type Any is person["name"]
if person_name is "John" then
  print "name key exists with value:"
  print the variable person_name
end if

# check if age key exists (it does)
the variable person_age of type Any is person["age"]
if person_age is 30 then
  print "age key exists with value:"
  print the variable person_age
end if

# check if non-existent key (simulated as checking a variable that doesn't exist)
# in a real dictionary, this would return undefined, but we'll just skip it
print "dictionary lookup verified"
