# test case 45
# description: Test Case 45: Verify that we can filter out even numbers from a list of integers.

define function filter_odds that takes input_list as List of Number and returns List of Number
  the variable result_list of type List of Number is an empty list
  
  for each n in input_list do
    the variable remainder of type Number is n modulo 2
    if remainder is not 0 then
      call add on result_list with n
    end if
  end for
  
  return result_list

# simulate a list of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
the variable numbers of type List of Number is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# filter out even numbers (keep odd numbers)
the variable odd_numbers of type List of Number is call function filter_odds with argument numbers

# verify filtered list (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5)
print "original list:"
print numbers
print "odd numbers:"
print odd_numbers
print "count:"
print odd_numbers.size
