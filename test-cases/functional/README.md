# Functional Programming Test Suite

Layman supports functional programming paradigms, treating functions as first-class citizens. This directory validates the implementation of these higher-level concepts, ensuring the language is flexible enough for functional styles.

## Concepts Covered
- **Use of `call`**: Explicitly invoking functions stored in variables or passed as arguments.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as input arguments or return them as output.
- **Closures**: Functions that capture and retain access to variables from their defining scope, even after that scope has closed.
- **Map/Filter/Reduce**: Implementing common functional patterns for list processing using the language's primitives.
