# Accessing list elements is 1-based in Layman?
# Let's check Evaluator implementation of IndexExpression.
# Evaluator: "List index starts at 1" (lines 390-391)
# So we use 1, 2, 3.

# Wait, I need to check if I can access list elements by index.
# Yes, `parts[1]` syntax is supported by parser?
# Let's assume yes, or use loop.
