# Standard Library Test Suite

Layman comes with a standard library of built-in modules to provide common functionality. This suite verifies that these modules are correctly implemented and available to user programs.

## Concepts Covered
- **Math Module**: Testing mathematical constants (`pi`) and functions (`sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`).
- **String Module**: Testing string manipulation utilities.
- **Time Module**: Testing time-related functions like `sleep` or current time retrieval.
- **Built-in Functions**: Verifying the behavior of globally available functions that don't need explicit imports.
