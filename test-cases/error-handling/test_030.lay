# description: Test Case 30: Handling Division by 0 Error - The program attempts to divide a number by 0 using division operator and verifies if the program throws a meaningful error message indicating division by 0 error.

define function check_division_by_zero that takes dummy as Number and returns Void
  the variable x of type Number is 5
  the variable y of type Number is 0
  
  try
    the variable result of type Number is x divided by y
    print the variable result
  catch error
    print "error: " + error
  end try
  return nothing

# test division by 0 handling
the variable dummy_value of type Number is 0
call function check_division_by_zero with argument dummy_value

print "the program completed successfully"
