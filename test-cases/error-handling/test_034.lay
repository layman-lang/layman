# test case 34
# description: Here is a test case description for Test Case Number 34:

# A program performing a database query asynchronously should return an empty list after simulating a connection timeout, ensuring that the operation does not indefinitely wait on a failed connection attempt.

define function connect_to_database that takes dummy as Number and returns Number
  # simulate database connection with timeout
  the variable connection_timeout of type Bool is true
  
  if connection_timeout is true then
    throw "Connection timed out"
  end if
  
  the variable result of type Number is call function call_query with argument dummy
  return result

define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  the variable result of type Number is a plus b
  return result

define function call_query that takes connection as Number and returns Number
  # simulate query execution
  the variable query_result of type Number is 5
  return query_result

# test database connection with timeout
the variable dummy_value of type Number is 0

try
  the variable db_result of type Number is call function connect_to_database with argument dummy_value
  print "database query successful"
  print the variable db_result
catch error
  print "database connection timed out, returned empty result"
end try
