# test case 70
# description: Here is the test case description:

# The program should successfully handle a division by 0 error when attempting to calculate a result and include a clear informative error message in output to inform the user of the issue. The program's attempt to perform the calculation with the provided numbers should fail gracefully without crashing, allowing the user to identify the cause of the problem.

# test division by 0 handling
the variable number_one of type Number is 10
the variable number_two of type Number is 0
the variable number_three of type Number is 5

# check for division by 0
try
  the variable result of type Number is number_one divided by number_two
  print "the result of the calculation is"
  print the variable result
catch error
  print "an error occurred, cannot divide by 0"
end try

# test normal division
try
  the variable normal_result of type Number is number_one divided by number_three
  print "the result of the calculation is"
  print the variable normal_result
catch error
  print "an error occurred, cannot divide by 0"
end try
