# description: Test Case 90: Handling Division by 0 - The program should attempt to divide a number by 0 in an expression and catch the resulting error, printing an informative error message instead of crashing.

# test division by 0 error handling
the variable number_one of type Number is 10
the variable number_two of type Number is 0
the variable number_three of type Number is 5

# check for division by 0
try
  the variable result of type Number is number_one divided by number_two
  print the variable result
catch error
  print "error: " + error
end try

# test normal division
try
  the variable normal_result of type Number is number_one divided by number_three
  print "calculation result:"
  print the variable normal_result
catch error
  print "error: " + error
end try
