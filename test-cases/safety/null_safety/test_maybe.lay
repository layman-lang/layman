# Test Null Safety

# 1. Declare maybe type
the variable x of type maybe Number is nothing

# 2. Check existence (should be false)
if x exists then
    print "x exists (fail)"
else
    print "x does not exist (pass)"
end if

# 3. Assign value
set x to 42

# 4. Check existence (should be true)
if x exists then
    print "x exists (pass)"
else
    print "x does not exist (fail)"
end if

# 5. Declare with value
the variable y of type maybe String is "Hello"

if y exists then
    print "y exists (pass)"
end if

# 6. Assign nothing
set y to nothing

if y exists then
    print "y exists (fail)"
else
    print "y is nothing (pass)"
end if

# 7. Nested maybe (Maybe<Maybe<Number>>)
# Not explicitly supported by syntax "maybe maybe Number" but "maybe Number" covers it?
# "maybe Number" means Number | Nothing.
# "maybe maybe Number" would be (Number | Nothing) | Nothing, which collapses to Number | Nothing.
# So we don't need to test nested maybe specifically unless we have distinct Nothing levels.
