# Safety and Stability Test Suite

This suite focuses on the language's safety features and edge cases that might compromise stability if not handled correctly.

## Concepts Covered
- **Null Safety**: Testing the `Nothing` type and verifying that the language prevents common null-reference errors.
- **Type Safety Checks**: Ensuring the type checker catches unsafe operations at compile time.
- **Boundary Testing**: Testing limits like maximum recursion depth, integer overflow, or extremely large data structures.
