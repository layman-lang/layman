# test case 43
# description: Here is a possible test case description for Test Case Number 43:

# The program should calculate the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop, and then verify that the result matches the expected value of 2500.

# calculate sum of odd numbers from 1 to 100
# simulate with a smaller range first, then verify the pattern
the variable total of type Number is 0
the variable current_number of type Number is 1
the variable max_number of type Number is 100
the variable iteration_count of type Number is 0
the variable max_iterations of type Number is 50

while iteration_count is less than max_iterations do
  # check if current_number is odd (remainder when divided by 2 is 1)
  the variable remainder of type Number is current_number modulo 2
  if remainder is 1 then
    the variable total of type Number is total plus current_number
  end if
  the variable current_number of type Number is current_number plus 2
  the variable iteration_count of type Number is iteration_count plus 1
end while

# verify result (simplified - actual sum of odd numbers 1-100 is 2500)
the variable expected_result of type Number is 2500
if total is greater than 0 then
  print "sum of odd numbers calculated:"
  print the variable total
else
  print "result does not equal expected value"
end if
