# test case 95
# description: The test case will calculate the total cost of renting a house for 1 year by applying an initial deposit and monthly rent, then checking if the result matches a predefined expected value. The test scenario should account for varying amounts of initial deposits and monthly rents to ensure the program handles these variations correctly.

define function calculate_total_cost that takes amount as Number and rent as Number and returns Number
  # calculate cost: amount + (rent * 12)
  the variable rent_times_twelve of type Number is rent times 12
  the variable cost of type Number is amount plus rent_times_twelve
  return cost

# test with different deposit amounts and monthly rents
the variable expected_value of type Number is 12000
the variable initial_deposit_one of type Number is 1000
the variable initial_deposit_two of type Number is 2000
the variable initial_deposit_three of type Number is 3000

the variable monthly_rent_one of type Number is 500
the variable monthly_rent_two of type Number is 800
the variable monthly_rent_three of type Number is 1000

# calculate total cost for first deposit and first rent
the variable total_cost_one of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_one and argument monthly_rent_one

# calculate total cost for first deposit and second rent
the variable total_cost_two of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_one and argument monthly_rent_two

# calculate total cost for first deposit and third rent
the variable total_cost_three of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_one and argument monthly_rent_three

# calculate total cost for second deposit and first rent
the variable total_cost_four of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_two and argument monthly_rent_one

# calculate total cost for second deposit and second rent
the variable total_cost_five of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_two and argument monthly_rent_two

# calculate total cost for second deposit and third rent
the variable total_cost_six of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_two and argument monthly_rent_three

# calculate total cost for third deposit and first rent
the variable total_cost_seven of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_three and argument monthly_rent_one

# calculate total cost for third deposit and second rent
the variable total_cost_eight of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_three and argument monthly_rent_two

# calculate total cost for third deposit and third rent
the variable total_cost_nine of type Number is call function calculate_total_cost with argument initial_deposit_three and argument monthly_rent_three
