# test case 76
# description: Here is a possible test case description for layman programming language test case number 76:

# The test calculates the sum of 2 numbers and checks if the result matches the expected value, demonstrating basic mathematical operations with variables.

define function add_numbers that takes x as Number and y as Number and returns Number
  return x plus y

define function calculate_average that takes item as Number and total as Number and returns Number
  if total is not 0 then
    return item divided by total
  else
    return 0
  end if

# test sum calculation
the variable sum of type Number is 0
the variable x of type Number is 5
the variable y of type Number is 3

the variable result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument x and argument y
the variable result of type Number is result plus sum

# verify result
if result is 8 then
  print "the value of result:"
  print the variable result
else
  print "incorrect"
end if

# test average calculation
the variable item_value of type Number is 10
the variable total_value of type Number is 2
the variable average of type Number is call function calculate_average with argument item_value and argument total_value

print "the value of the variable average:"
print the variable average
