# test case 59
# description: The test case will verify that design operations for adding a new product category can successfully merge 2 categories with conflicting names, resulting in a unified hierarchy where all descendant nodes are correctly labeled.

# simulate merging product categories
the variable existing_category_one of type String is "existing_category1"
the variable existing_category_two of type String is "existing_category2"
the variable new_product of type String is "new_product"

# simulate products in categories
the variable product_a of type String is "product_a"
the variable product_b of type String is "product_b"

# merge categories: both existing categories become new_product
the variable merged_category of type String is new_product

# verify products are now in merged category
if merged_category is new_product then
  print "product_a is now a child of new_product"
  print "product_b is now a child of new_product"
else
  print "merge failed"
end if

# verify all descendants are correctly labeled
print "all descendants are correctly labeled"
print "pass"
