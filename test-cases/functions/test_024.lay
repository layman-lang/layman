# description: A programming language should be able to define functions with variable names and then call those functions from within other functions of the same language. The program should compile successfully when run in a standard interpreter without errors, warnings, or output. This ensures that the language's syntax allows for function reuse and modularity.

define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  the variable result of type Number is a plus b
  return result

define function get_name that takes person_name as String and returns String
  if person_name is not "" then
    return person_name
  else
    return ""
  end if

define function greet that takes name as String and returns Void
  the variable greeting of type String is call function concatenate with argument name and argument " is here!"
  print the variable greeting
  return nothing

# test function calls from within other contexts
the variable person_name of type String is "John Doe"
the variable name_result of type String is call function get_name with argument person_name
call function greet with argument person_name

# test add_numbers function
the variable sum_result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument 5 and argument 3
print the variable sum_result
