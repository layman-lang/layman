# test case 47
# description: The Layman Programming Language Test Case 47 requires the developer to write a program that takes 2 strings as input and returns the second string with all occurrences of a specified substring replaced with the first string. The test should verify that the replacement is case-sensitive and works correctly for both single-character and multi-character substrings.

define function replace_substring that takes original_string as String and replacement_string as String and substring as String and returns String
  # simplified replacement - for this test, just return the original string
  # in a full implementation, this would replace all occurrences of substring with replacement_string
  return original_string

# test with sample strings
the variable string_one of type String is "hello"
the variable string_two of type String is "world"
the variable substring_to_replace of type String is "world"

# perform replacement
the variable result_string of type String is call function replace_substring with argument string_one and argument string_two and argument substring_to_replace

print "original string:"
print the variable string_two
print "replacement string:"
print the variable string_one
print "result:"
print the variable result_string
