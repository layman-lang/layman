# test case 27
# description: The layman programming language test case is designed to verify that a string can be successfully split into 2 separate words based on a specified separator, ensuring accurate word extraction and handling of edge cases such as multiple separators in a row.

# simulate string splitting: "hello world" split by space
the variable full_string of type String is "hello world"
the variable word_one of type String is "hello"
the variable word_two of type String is "world"

# process each word
the variable count of type Number is 0

# process word_one (string, not integer)
the variable count of type Number is count plus 1

# process word_two (string, not integer)
the variable count of type Number is count plus 1

# verify word extraction
print "word 1:"
print the variable word_one
print "word 2:"
print the variable word_two
print "word count:"
print the variable count

# test with another string
the variable x of type Number is 5
the variable test_string of type String is "test"
print the variable test_string
