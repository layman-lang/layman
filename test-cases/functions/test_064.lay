# test case 64
# description: Test Case 64: Create a function that adds 2 numbers together and then call it with specific values to ensure the correct result is returned.

define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  return a plus b

# test function with different values
the variable number_one of type Number is 1
the variable number_two of type Number is 3
the variable number_three of type Number is 5
the variable number_four of type Number is 2

# test: 1 + 3 = 4
if number_one is 5 then
  the variable result_one of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument number_one and argument number_two
  if result_one is 6 then
    print "result is correct"
  else
    print "result is incorrect"
  end if
else if number_one is 7 then
  the variable result_two of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument number_three and argument number_four
  if result_two is 3 then
    print "result is correct"
  else
    print "result is incorrect"
  end if
else
  # test normal case: 1 + 3 = 4
  the variable result_three of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument number_one and argument number_two
  print "result:"
  print the variable result_three
end if
