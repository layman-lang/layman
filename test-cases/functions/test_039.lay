# description: Test Case 39: Design Operations - Creating a New Project. The system should allow users to create a new project with default settings and then attempt to save it without adding any design elements, verifying that an error message is displayed indicating that at least 1 element must be added to the project.

define function show_error_message that takes message as String and returns Void
  print the variable message
  return nothing

define function save_project that takes dummy as Number and returns Void
  print "project saved successfully"
  return nothing

# main program starts here

# test project creation with 0 design elements
the variable count_of_design_elements of type Number is 0

if count_of_design_elements is 0 then
  the variable error_msg of type String is "at least 1 element must be added"
  call function show_error_message with argument error_msg
else
  call function save_project with argument 0
  print "project saved successfully"
end if

# simulate adding design elements
the variable element_one of type Number is 1
the variable element_two of type Number is 2
the variable count_of_design_elements of type Number is count_of_design_elements plus element_one
the variable count_of_design_elements of type Number is count_of_design_elements plus element_two

# verify project can be saved after adding elements
if count_of_design_elements is 0 then
  the variable error_msg_two of type String is "at least 1 element must be added"
  call function show_error_message with argument error_msg_two
else
  print "project saved successfully"
end if
