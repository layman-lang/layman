# test case 61
# description: The test case "Simple Variable Declaration and Assignment" will demonstrate the ability to declare a variable with an initial value, assign a new value to it, and verify that these assignments are reflected in the program output. The test involves creating a simple variable declaration, assigning values to it using different assignment operators, and checking for correct results.

# declare variable with initial value
the variable name of type Number is 5

# declare and assign another variable
the variable age of type Number is 20

# perform arithmetic operations on age
the variable age of type Number is age plus 1
the variable age of type Number is age times 2
the variable age of type Number is age minus 3

# test conditional based on age
if age is greater than 30 then
  print "old"
else
  print "young"
end if

# test variable operations
the variable age_divided of type Number is age divided by 2
print "age divided by 2:"
print the variable age_divided

print "final age value:"
print the variable age
