# test case 32
# description: The test case will exercise the pipeline operation functionality by creating 2 pipelines, 1 that filters and sorts an array of numbers, and another that logs and aggregates errors in a specific scenario. The test will then verify that the output of both pipelines is correct and as expected.

define function filter_even that takes number as Number and returns Bool
  the variable remainder of type Number is number modulo 2
  if remainder is 0 then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end if

define function process_number that takes number as Number and returns Number
  # simulate filtering and sorting pipeline
  the variable is_even of type Bool is call function filter_even with argument number
  if is_even is true then
    return number
  else
    return 0
  end if

# test pipeline with numbers
the variable number_one of type Number is 1
the variable number_two of type Number is 2
the variable number_three of type Number is 3
the variable number_four of type Number is 4
the variable number_five of type Number is 5

# process each number through pipeline
the variable result_one of type Number is call function process_number with argument number_one
the variable result_two of type Number is call function process_number with argument number_two
the variable result_three of type Number is call function process_number with argument number_three
the variable result_four of type Number is call function process_number with argument number_four
the variable result_five of type Number is call function process_number with argument number_five

# aggregate results
the variable total of type Number is result_one plus result_two plus result_three plus result_four plus result_five

print "pipeline processing completed"
print the variable total
