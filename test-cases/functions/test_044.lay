# test case 44
# description: Test Case 44: A simple calculator program should define 2 functions to add and multiply numbers, then call these functions with different inputs to demonstrate that the output is correct, verifying the basic functionality of the program.

define function add_numbers that takes x as Number and y as Number and returns Number
  return x plus y

define function multiply_numbers that takes x as Number and y as Number and returns Number
  return x times y

# test the functions
the variable x of type Number is 5
the variable y of type Number is 3

# call add function
the variable z of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument x and argument y

# call multiply function
the variable w of type Number is call function multiply_numbers with argument x and argument y

# verify results
if z is 8 then
  print "the sum of x and y is correct"
else
  print "the sum of x and y is incorrect"
end if

if w is 15 then
  print "the product of x and y is correct"
else
  print "the product of x and y is incorrect"
end if

print the variable z
print the variable w
