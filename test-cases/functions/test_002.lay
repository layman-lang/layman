# test case 2
# description: As a program processes weather forecasts for a given day, it must correctly predict whether outdoor activities such as swimming are suitable based on the temperature and humidity levels if they are above or below 75 degrees Fahrenheit; otherwise, the forecast will mention alternative activities. The test verifies that the program responds with the correct recommendation when the conditions meet these criteria.

define function check_temperature that takes temperature as Number and activity as String and returns Bool
  if temperature is less than 60 then
    print "swimming is not recommended due to cold weather"
    return false
  else if temperature is greater than 74 then
    print "the activity is suitable for warm weather"
    return true
  else
    print "an error in the temperature reading"
    return false
  end if

define function current_temperature that takes dummy as Number and returns Number
  return 70

define function current_humidity that takes dummy as Number and returns String
  return "high"

# get current weather conditions
the variable dummy_value of type Number is 0
the variable temperature of type Number is call function current_temperature with argument dummy_value
the variable humidity_level of type String is call function current_humidity with argument dummy_value

# determine if swimming is suitable
if temperature is greater than 74 then
  if humidity_level is "very high" then
    print "alternative activities for warm weather"
  else
    print "swimming is suitable for the day"
  end if
else
  the variable activity of type String is "swimming"
  the variable is_suitable of type Bool is call function check_temperature with argument temperature and argument activity
  if is_suitable is false then
    print "the activity is not suitable for low temperatures"
  end if
end if
