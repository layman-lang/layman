# test case 9
# description: Here is a test case description for language test case number 9:

# Write a program that takes an integer as input and uses pattern matching to determine if it is even, odd, or a special value (e.g. "even", "odd", "unknown") based on the remainder when divided by a given divisor (e.g. 2).

# test with input number
the variable input_number of type Number is 10

# determine if number is even, odd, or unknown based on remainder when divided by 2
the variable divisor of type Number is 2
the variable remainder of type Number is input_number modulo divisor

if remainder is 0 then
  print "even"
else
  # check if it's odd
  if remainder is 1 then
    print "odd"
  else
    print "unknown"
  end if
end if

# test with another number
the variable input_number_two of type Number is 11
the variable remainder_two of type Number is input_number_two modulo divisor

if remainder_two is 0 then
  print "even"
else if remainder_two is 1 then
  print "odd"
else
  print "unknown"
end if
