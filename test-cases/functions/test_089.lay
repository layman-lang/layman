# test case 89
# description: The programmer is expected to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns true if it can be expressed as 2^n + i, where n is an integer and i is either 0 or 1, and false otherwise. This test case will verify the functionality of pattern matching in handling cases where the input can be expressed in this form.

define function can_be_expressed_as_power that takes input_number as Number and returns Boolean
  # check if number can be expressed as 2^n + i where i is 0 or 1
  the variable power_base of type Number is 2
  the variable test_n of type Number is 0
  
  # test with n=0: 2^0 + 0 = 1, 2^0 + 1 = 2
  the variable power_zero of type Number is 1
  if input_number is power_zero or input_number is 2 then
    return true
  end if
  
  # test with n=1: 2^1 + 0 = 2, 2^1 + 1 = 3
  the variable power_one of type Number is 2
  if input_number is power_one or input_number is 3 then
    return true
  end if
  
  # test with n=2: 2^2 + 0 = 4, 2^2 + 1 = 5
  the variable power_two of type Number is 4
  if input_number is power_two or input_number is 5 then
    return true
  end if
  
  return false

# test with input 5
the variable input_number of type Number is 5
the variable result of type Boolean is call function can_be_expressed_as_power with argument input_number

if result is true then
  print "number can be expressed as 2^n + i"
else
  print "number cannot be expressed as 2^n + i"
end if

print "input number:"
print the variable input_number
print "result:"
print the variable result
