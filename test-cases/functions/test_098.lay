# description: Test Case 98: Validate Successful Login with Valid Credentials - The system should validate a user's login attempt using valid username and password credentials to ensure successful access to the dashboard.

define function validate_login that takes username as String and password as String and returns Boolean
  # simulate checking credentials
  the variable valid_username of type String is "john_doe"
  the variable valid_password of type String is "password123"
  
  if username is valid_username and password is valid_password then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end if

define function grant_access that takes account_name as String and access_status as String and returns Void
  print "access granted to:"
  print the variable account_name
  print "access status:"
  print the variable access_status

define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  return a plus b

# test login validation
the variable username of type String is "john_doe"
the variable password of type String is "password123"

the variable login_result of type Boolean is call function validate_login with argument username and argument password

if login_result is true then
  print "successful login to the dashboard"
  call function grant_access with argument username and argument "access granted"
else
  print "invalid login attempt to the console"
end if

# test with numbers
the variable a of type Number is 1
the variable a of type Number is a plus 2
the variable b of type Number is 3
the variable b of type Number is b times 4

the variable sum_result of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument a and argument b

if sum_result is greater than 0 then
  print "the sum of a and b:"
  print the variable sum_result
else
  print "an error message to the console"
end if
