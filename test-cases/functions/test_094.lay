# test case 94
# description: Test Case Description:

# Write an async function that retrieves data from a mock API and waits for its response before performing additional operations, demonstrating proper handling of asynchronous code and awaiting resolution. The test should verify that the function correctly handles both successful and failed API responses, logging the result accordingly. This test ensures the ability to write clean and efficient async code in the programming language.

define function get_user_data that takes name as String and returns Boolean
  print "getting user data for:"
  print the variable name
  
  # simulate api response
  if name is "John" then
    print "got user data: John has 30 years old"
    return true
  else if name is "Jane" then
    print "got user data: Jane has 25 years old"
    return true
  else
    print "failed to get user data"
    return false
  end if

define function process_person that takes person_name as String and returns Void
  the variable result of type Boolean is call function get_user_data with argument person_name
  
  if result is true then
    print "person added to favorites"
  else
    print "person not added to favorites"
  end if
  
  return nothing

# simulate processing people list
the variable person_one of type String is "John"
call function process_person with argument person_one

the variable person_two of type String is "Jane"
call function process_person with argument person_two

the variable person_three of type String is "Bob"
call function process_person with argument person_three

print "processing completed"
