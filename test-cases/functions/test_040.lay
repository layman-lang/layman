# test case 40
# description: A simple arithmetic expression is evaluated to verify that it returns the expected result when the 2 numbers being added together are both positive integers and when 1 of them is a negative integer. The test will check if the program handles these scenarios correctly and consistently, without any errors or unexpected behavior.

define function add_numbers that takes a as Number and b as Number and returns Number
  return a plus b

# test with positive integers
the variable number1 of type Number is 5
the variable number2 of type Number is 3
the variable result_positive of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument number1 and argument number2

print "result with positive numbers:"
print the variable result_positive

# test with 1 negative integer
the variable number3 of type Number is 5
the variable number4 of type Number is minus 3
the variable result_mixed of type Number is call function add_numbers with argument number3 and argument number4

print "result with mixed numbers:"
print the variable result_mixed

# verify results
if result_positive is 8 then
  print "positive addition correct"
else
  print "error occurred during calculation"
end if

if result_mixed is 2 then
  print "mixed addition correct"
else
  print "error occurred during calculation"
end if
