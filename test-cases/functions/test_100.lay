# test case 100
# description: simple arithmetic operations and a small loop

define function sum_two that takes x as Number and y as Number and returns Number
  return x plus y

# basic arithmetic
 the variable a of type Number is 2
 the variable b of type Number is 3
 the variable c of type Number is call function sum_two with argument a and argument b
 print the variable c

# iterate a few times to ensure loops work
 the variable count of type Number is 0
 while count is less than 5 do
   print the variable count
   the variable count of type Number is count plus 1
 end while
