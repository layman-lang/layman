# test case 99
# description: Here is the test case description:

"Test that adding 2 new design elements to an existing collection results in a single, unified set of designs with no duplicate elements."

# simulate adding design elements to a collection
the variable existing_designs of type Number is 1
the variable new_design_one of type Number is 2
the variable new_design_two of type Number is 3

# add new designs to collection
the variable total_designs of type Number is existing_designs plus new_design_one
the variable total_designs of type Number is total_designs plus new_design_two

# verify no duplicates (each design is unique)
if total_designs is 6 then
  print "single unified set of designs with no duplicate elements"
  print "total designs:"
  print the variable total_designs
else
  print "duplicate design elements found"
end if

# verify collection is unified
the variable unified_count of type Number is 3
if total_designs is existing_designs plus new_design_one plus new_design_two then
  print "collection is unified"
else
  print "collection is not unified"
end if
