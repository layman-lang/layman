# test case 42
# description: Test Case 42: "If it's sunny outside, then print 'Go for a walk', otherwise print 'Stay inside'." This test case checks that the programming language handles conditional statements correctly, specifically if/then/otherwise clauses. The test verifies that the output is as expected given different input conditions.

# test conditional statements with different weather conditions
the variable weather_forecast_one of type String is "sunny"
the variable weather_forecast_two of type String is "rainy"

# test first forecast: if sunny, go for walk, otherwise stay inside
if weather_forecast_one is "sunny" then
  print "Go for a walk"
else
  print "Stay inside"
end if

# test second forecast: if sunny, go for walk, otherwise stay inside
if weather_forecast_two is "sunny" then
  print "Go for a walk"
else
  print "Stay inside"
end if
