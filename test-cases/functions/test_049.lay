# test case 49
# description: The test case, number 49, "Pattern Matching with String Literal", involves writing a program that uses pattern matching to extract specific information from a string literal. The program should correctly identify and return a specific value if a certain condition is met within the string, and fail otherwise.

define function is_adult that takes age as Number and name as String and returns Bool
  if age is 35 then
    return true
  else
    return false
  end if

# test pattern matching with string literal
the variable name of type String is "john"
the variable age of type Number is 35

# check if name matches pattern and age condition
if name is "john" then
  if age is 35 then
    the variable is_adult_result of type Bool is call function is_adult with argument age and argument name
    if is_adult_result is true then
      print "pattern matched: john is adult"
    else
      print "pattern matched but not adult"
    end if
  else
    print "name matched but age condition failed"
  end if
else
  print "pattern matching failed"
end if
