# test case 82
# description: Here is a possible test case description for test case number 82:

# The program should correctly handle the scenario where the user inputs an age that requires a senior discount but not a student discount, and display "You qualify for a senior discount". If the input age falls within the range of 65-70, the output should be different from what is displayed when the age falls outside this range.

define function print_message that takes message as String and returns Void
  print the variable message
  return nothing

# test age-based discount eligibility
the variable age of type Number is 67
the variable senior_age_range_start of type Number is 65
the variable senior_age_range_end of type Number is 70

# check if age qualifies for senior discount
the variable age_plus_eighteen of type Number is age plus 18
if age_plus_eighteen is senior_age_range_start and age is less than or equal to senior_age_range_end then
  call function print_message with argument "You qualify for a senior discount"
else if age_plus_eighteen is senior_age_range_start then
  call function print_message with argument "You qualify for a student discount"
else
  call function print_message with argument "You do not qualify for any discounts"
end if

# test with threshold values
the variable threshold_one of type Number is senior_age_range_end
the variable threshold_two of type Number is senior_age_range_start

print "threshold values:"
print the variable threshold_one
print the variable threshold_two

print "age years old:"
print the variable age
