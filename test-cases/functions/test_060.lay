# test case 60
# description: Test Case 60: Evaluate simple arithmetic expressions to ensure correct calculation of sums, differences, products, and quotients with integers.

# test simple arithmetic expressions
the variable number_one of type Number is 2
the variable number_two of type Number is 3
the variable number_three of type Number is 4

# test addition
the variable sum_result of type Number is number_one plus number_two
print "sum result:"
print the variable sum_result

# test subtraction
the variable diff_result of type Number is number_three minus number_one
print "difference result:"
print the variable diff_result

# test multiplication
the variable product_result of type Number is number_one times number_two
print "product result:"
print the variable product_result

# test division
the variable quotient_result of type Number is number_three divided by number_one
print "quotient result:"
print the variable quotient_result

# verify all calculations
if sum_result is 5 then
  print "addition correct"
else
  print "addition incorrect"
end if

if diff_result is 2 then
  print "subtraction correct"
else
  print "subtraction incorrect"
end if
