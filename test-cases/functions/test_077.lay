# test case 77
# description: Here is a test case description for layman programming language test case number 77:

# The test verifies that the program correctly concatenates multiple strings together and returns the resulting string, with example inputs including "Hello World" + ", " followed by a single quote and then another string. The expected output should be a single concatenated string without any extra characters.

# test string concatenation
the variable string_one of type String is "Hello World"
the variable separator of type String is ", "
the variable string_two of type String is "test"

# concatenate strings
the variable step_one of type String is call function concatenate with argument string_one and argument separator
the variable result of type String is call function concatenate with argument step_one and argument string_two

# verify concatenation
print "concatenated string:"
print the variable result

# test with additional strings
the variable additional_string of type String is " more text"
the variable final_result of type String is call function concatenate with argument result and argument additional_string

print the variable final_result
