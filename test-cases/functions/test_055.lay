# test case 55
# description: The test case should calculate the total cost of renting an apartment for a month after applying a discount of $200 on a monthly rent of $1200 and a security deposit of $500, and verify that the total comes out to be $1500.

define function calculate_total that takes monthly_rent as Number and security_deposit as Number and returns Number
  # apply discount of $200
  the variable discount of type Number is 200
  the variable rent_after_discount of type Number is monthly_rent minus discount
  # add security deposit
  the variable total_cost of type Number is rent_after_discount plus security_deposit
  return total_cost

# calculate total cost
the variable monthly_rent of type Number is 1200
the variable security_deposit of type Number is 500

the variable total_cost of type Number is call function calculate_total with argument monthly_rent and argument security_deposit

# verify total is $1500 (1200 - 200 + 500 = 1500)
the variable expected_total of type Number is 1500
if total_cost is expected_total then
  print "total cost is correct:"
  print the variable total_cost
else
  print "total cost calculation error"
  print the variable total_cost
end if
